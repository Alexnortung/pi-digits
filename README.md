# Introduction

This project was made for pi day (3/14) to calculate digits of using the programming language Rust. There have been implemented two algorithms leibniz and chudnovsky. This project is also based on [Rug](https://docs.rs/rug/1.7.0/rug/) to get arbitrary interger and floating point number precision.

# Requirements

Rust

# Installation

clone the repo and run

```
cargo update
```

# Run the program

The program can be run with `cargo run`

# Todo

* Choose algorithm from stdin
* Choose bit-precision from stdin
* Choose how many digits you want to calculate from stdin.
